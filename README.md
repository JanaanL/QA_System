# Question Answering System
This is a project created for the Fall 2022 University of Utah CS 6340 Natural Language Processing Class.  The project is to design and build a question answering system.  For the project, stories from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation fweb page for kids were used.  MITRE Corporation created questions and an answer key for each story.  The aim of this project was to create a question answering system that could process a story and a list of questions and produce an answer for each question.
